# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This is my first project using springboot framework and this is a simple CRUD application with basic create, read, update, delete methods.In this project, i developed only the backend and there is no frontend. This is just a test application and **i am currently learning new things in springboot**.And i used Maven tools for this project.
#
## I used the following dependencies for develop this
* spring web
* spring data JPA (SQL)
* MySQL driver
* lombok
* ModelMapper

# 
## I used following annotations for the backend
* @Entity - to make a class as a entity class
* @id - to specify the primary key
* @Query - to specify queries
* @RestController - to specify a restcontroller
* @RequestMapping - to map Http methods
* @CrossOrigin - for cross origin resource sharing
* @Autowired - for dependency injection
* @Service - to specify the service layer
* @Transaction - to handle transactions
* @AllArgsConstructor,@NoArgsConstructor - since i used lombok there, there are no these types of annotations

#
## These are my backend packages
* Usercontroller
* Entity
* UserDTO
* UserRepo
* UserService

#
## I used following query types
* Query methods - save(), find(), findall(), delete()
* Native queries

#
Since there is no frontend, i used postman tool to check request API endpoints.I hope to learn more and build more spring projects.
